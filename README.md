A tour into the Wuhan seafood market.

Click on the yellow dots to walk through the market.

All but a few images with vendors were taken on December 31 between the first rumors and the market closure at 1am of January 1. Most other pictures show disinfection and were taken in January, originating from a lot of different Chinese websites - try searching for 华南海鲜市场, paying attention to the few videos.

The map of the market comes from the WHO report. The locations are often easy to find as 西 区 六 街 means west zone 6 street and 东 区 十二 街 means east zone 12 street.

The bottles seem to contain compressed air for bubbling into the fish crates in order to keep them alive. That's a way to spot which parts of the market really are dedicated to seafood.
